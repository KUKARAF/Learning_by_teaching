The idea of this repo is to create a list of topics that we want to polish/explain to eachother/learn by explaining.

My suggestion for this project is to create folders for topics like [[Version control/git/basics]], frontend, backand, apis and subfolders for underlying technologies and explore/explain in detail.

All this can be done, remotely, on our own terms all while publicly showcasing our progress, skills and keeping eachother accountable.
